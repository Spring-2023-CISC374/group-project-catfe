# who worked on what
Anthony Racioppo:
- Set up initial code base for preloading, title screen, functions for handling submitting orders, base functionality of gameplay elements, ingredients, clear button, cat generation, validity check for orders


Jillian Camp:
- Worked on tutorial pop-ups mechanic. 
- Changed the name of TutorialScene to GameScene, and then created my own TutorialScene with the pop-ups for the tutorial.
- Edited TitleScene.ts to execute `this.game.start('TutorialScene')` in order to visualize the pop-ups mechanic.
- Did not yet make my mechanic work in tandem with GameScene or BaseScene. 
- To see my work: 
$ git checkout -b jill
$ git fetch origin jill
